**METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION**

1\. Eleven lakes within the North Temperate Lakes were accessed via boat and fish were recorded via tramp nets; fish type varied, but evaluted here was Trout Perch. Measurments on length, weight, sex, etc. were taken, but only length and weight were evaluted here. 

2\.  Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the
data: The package "lterdatasampler" is paired with the data package and required for analysis in R, otherwise packages are dependent on variables and conditions of interest and related analysis.

3\. Data analysis used linear regression modeling to evalute the relationship between fish weight and length.
